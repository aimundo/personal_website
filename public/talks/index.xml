      <title>Statistics and Reproducibility in Biomedical Research</title>

      <description>DescriptionI had the privilege talking this year at the 2022 Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility Conference. I shared some thoughts on the struggle for reproducibility in Biomedical Research. Because I prepared the talk while completing my dissertation, I did not have time to make some nice xaringan slides (sorry, I know). But, the talk was recorded and can be found in the link above.
The motivation for this talk came from my experience and (constant) struggle with Statistics during the first years of my PhD.</description>

      <title>Using Generalized Additive Models for Biomedical Longitudinal data</title>

      <description>DescriptionThis talk at the RMedicine 2021 Conference covers in a brief way the statistical treatment of longitudinal data with an emphasis on biomedical research, showing in a visual way the limitations of linear models (rm-ANOVa or LMEMs) and how generalized additive models (GAMs) are useful to analyze non-linear data.
An in-depth coverage of this topic can be found in this preprint from our lab ( the manuscript is currently under review).</description>
