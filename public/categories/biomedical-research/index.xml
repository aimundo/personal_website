      <description>DescriptionI had the privilege talking this year at the 2022 Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility Conference. I shared some thoughts on the struggle for reproducibility in Biomedical Research. Because I prepared the talk while completing my dissertation, I did not have time to make some nice xaringan slides (sorry, I know). But, the talk was recorded and can be found in the link above.
The motivation for this talk came from my experience and (constant) struggle with Statistics during the first years of my PhD.</description>
