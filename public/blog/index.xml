      <description>Disclaimer: I am no Javascript expert. The target audience for this post are those that want to add something extra to their site, but that like me, have very little knowledge of JavaScript.
But let me say this: it’s doable, and that is the beauty of the Hugo Apéro theme, it is very well organized and makes it easy to follow!
How the idea startedA couple weeks ago I read a Tweet from Alison Presmanes Hill where se commented on the beauty of Deisy Gysi’s site.</description>

      <description>Why?This is the second post about working with Bookdown and my experience on the process (first post is here). This post focuses on how I found that was easy to compartmentalize my work and some tips I learned along the way (I will probably write about some other things in the future as well).
Use “chapters”When I started working with Bookdown I was making a single document for my manuscript.</description>
