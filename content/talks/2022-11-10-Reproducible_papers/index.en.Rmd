## Description 

This talk at the 2022 CANSSI Statistical Software Conference is intended for researchers in the life sciences, who can benefit from using R to create manuscripts that are reproducible.

When I started to use R to create manuscripts, I was under the impression that R was mainly for "Stats people". I quickly realized that that was not the case because {bookdown} provided all the tools required to create a paper that was reproducible and where I didn't have to worry about formatting issues.

However, one major block remained: How could I create a figure like the ones I had seen routinely in papers that combined images (from tissue, cells, pictures, or diagrams) with graphs summarizing data and statistical analyses? For some time, I thought it wasn't possible. But as the saying goes "life finds a way". And that's how this talk came about!

Note: The links above are for the GitHub repo that contains all the files to create a manuscript, and the slides for the talk at the conference.
