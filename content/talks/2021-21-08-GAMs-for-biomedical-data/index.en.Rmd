## Description 

This talk at the RMedicine 2021 Conference covers in a brief way the statistical treatment of longitudinal data with an emphasis on biomedical research, showing in a visual way the limitations of linear models (rm-ANOVa or LMEMs) and how generalized additive models (GAMs) are useful to analyze non-linear data.

An in-depth coverage of this topic can be found in [this](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.447970v1) preprint from our lab ( the manuscript is currently under review).

The GitHub repositories for the paper and the "lightning talk" can be accessed using the links above.
