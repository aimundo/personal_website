    I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville under the mentorship of [Tim Muldoon](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/people/) studying the dynamics of colon cancer. My postdoctoral tenure started in the lab of [Bouchra Nasri](https://www.bouchrarnasri.com/) at Université de Montréal, with the support of a [CRM-MfPH](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/public-health) fellowship. Presently, I am the lab of [Quoc Nguyen](https://www.chumontreal.qc.ca/en/crchum/chercheurs/quoc-dinh-nguyen) at CRCHUM, where my work focuses on improving health outcomes in geriatric populations.<br><br>My research interests lie at the intersection of biomedical data science, public health, and open science; I am an avid R user, always looking for the best color palette for dataviz.<br><br>Sponsors of my research include the [Fulbright Comission](https://gt.usembassy.gov/education/fulbright/fulbright-faculty-development-2025/), through the Faculty Development Program (formerly LASPAU), the [Arkansas Biosciences Institute](https://arbiosciences.org/), the [Fields Institute](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/public-health), and the [Canadian Institutes of Health Research](https://webapps.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/decisions/p/project_details.html?applId=481271&lang=en).
