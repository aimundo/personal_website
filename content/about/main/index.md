    I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville under the mentorship of [Tim Muldoon](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/people/). More recently, I have been a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Bouchra Nasri](https://www.bouchrarnasri.com/) at Université de Montréal. My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Science, Biomedical Research, and Public Health. <br><br> A full CV is available [**here**](Mundo_Ortiz_Ariel.pdf)
