I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of [Dr. Bouchra Nasri](https://www.bouchrarnasri.com/) at the University of Montreal, where I work with longitudinal biomedical data. I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville under the mentorship of [Dr. Tim Muldoon](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/people/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Open Science, Biology, and Statistics in order to better understand how biological processes change over time. <br><br>  &rarr [**CV**](Academic_CV_UdeM.pdf)
