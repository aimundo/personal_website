intro: |
    I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville under the mentorship of [Tim Muldoon](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/people/). More recently, I have been a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Bouchra Nasri](https://www.bouchrarnasri.com/) at Université de Montréal. My research interests lie at the intersection of Data Science, Biomedical Research, and Public Health. <br><br> Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my training, I have a wide array of skills which include: **Molecular biology**, **technical writing**, **statistical analysis**, **R**, and **public speaking**. I have also experience in **grant writing**, including funded projects by the [Arkansas Biosciences Institute](https://arbiosciences.org/) during my PhD training and more recently, a co-investigator role in a grant funded by [CIHR](https://webapps.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/decisions/p/project_details.html?applId=481271&lang=en) during my postdoctoral tenure. <br><br> A full CV is available [**here**](Resume_Ariel_Mundo_Nov13.pdf)
