    I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville under the mentorship of [Tim Muldoon](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/people/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Open Science, Biology, and Statistics in order to better understand how biological processes change over time. <br><br> My academic CV is available [**here**](Mundo_Ortiz_Ariel.pdf)
