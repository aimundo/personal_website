 I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville in the [Muldoon Lab](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/). I am interested in studying the temporal effects of therapy in cancer, and in how semi-parametric statistical models can be used by biomedical researchers to analyze longitudinal studies. Curiosity led me to take a class to learn R.  Little I knew that learning R and would change my view of Statistics and spark the desire to better understand Statistical theory. I enjoy using the `ggplot2` and `tidyverse` packages, and more recently, I have worked extensively to analyze longitudinal data using generalized additive models (GAMs) with the package `mgcv`. <br><br> **You can see my resume** [**here**](Resume_v1.pdf)
