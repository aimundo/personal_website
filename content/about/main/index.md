 I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville in the [Muldoon Lab](https://muldoonlab.uark.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of open science, biology, and statistics in order to better understand biological processes. My PhD started by developing optical tools to study cancer, but gradually shifted to a Statistics-centered approach to analyze biological data (using generalized additive models to analyze longitudinal data). I am particularly interested in studying the metabolic and molecular changes caused by disease over time using a combination of Statistics, Data Science and data visualization. <br><br> **You can see my Resume** [**here**](Resume_v1.pdf) **and my CV** [**here**](Academic_CV.pdf)
